# Personal Portfolio — GitHub Pages Starter

This is a minimal, mobile-friendly static portfolio starter you can publish on GitHub Pages.

What’s included
- `index.html` — single-page portfolio
- `css/styles.css` — styling and responsive layout
- `js/main.js` — theme toggle, mobile nav, and year injection

Quick start

1. Open this folder in VS Code and edit `index.html` to add your name, email, bio, and projects.
2. Update links (GitHub, LinkedIn) and replace sample project cards.
3. Initialize a Git repository, commit, and push to GitHub.

Publish on GitHub Pages (two common ways)

- User/Organization site (username.github.io):
  1. Create a repository named `your-username.github.io`.
  2. Push the contents of this folder to the repository's `main` branch.
  3. GitHub Pages will publish automatically at `https://your-username.github.io`.

- Project site (repo pages):
  1. Create any repository (e.g. `portfolio`).
  2. Push the contents to the `gh-pages` branch, or enable Pages to use `main`/`docs/` from repository settings.
  3. Visit `https://your-username.github.io/repository` when published.

Tips
- Replace placeholder text and sample project cards with real content.
- Add screenshots by placing images in an `assets/` folder and referencing them in `index.html`.
- Use GitHub Actions to build a site if you later switch to a static site generator.

Next steps (optional)
- Convert to Jekyll, Hugo, or a React site if you need more features.
- Add analytics (Privacy-conscious) or contact form via a provider like Formspree.
